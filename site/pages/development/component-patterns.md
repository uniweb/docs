# CCA Component Patterns

CCA components tend to be shorter, more reusable, and more composable than their traditional React equivalents. That's not because of extra abstraction — it's because CCA's separation of content, theming, and code removes entire categories of work from the component. No theme maps. No null checks. No hardcoded strings. What's left is the actual rendering logic.

But the separation also introduces a design question that doesn't come up in traditional React: how do you shape a component's interface when the people using it aren't developers? The params you expose, the content structure you expect, the variants you support — these form a vocabulary that content authors compose with. Getting that vocabulary right produces tighter components and fewer edge cases. The patterns in this guide are what's emerged from that work so far. More will surface as foundations get more ambitious.

If you're coming from a traditional React project — especially one with multiple pages that have similar-but-different sections — you'll want to read [Converting Existing Designs](./converting-existing-designs.md) first. That guide shows how to decompose pages into CCA components. This guide picks up where it leaves off: once you've identified the components, how do you design their interfaces?

## Organizing a Foundation

A foundation is a React project. Most of its code is ordinary React components — cards, buttons, layout helpers, renderers — with no special requirements. They live wherever makes sense: `ui/`, `lib/`, inline in the same file, npm packages. CCA doesn't know or care about them.

The only special thing in a foundation is the **content interface**: the small number of section types that content authors can reference by name in frontmatter (`type: Hero`, `type: Features`). These live in `src/sections/`, which is the foundation's **addressable zone** — the build treats everything at the root of this folder as a section type, whether it's a bare file or a folder.

```
src/
├── sections/                # Addressable zone — section types
│   ├── CTA.jsx              # Bare file → section type (no meta.js needed)
│   ├── Hero/
│   │   ├── meta.js          # Explicit content interface (params, presets)
│   │   ├── Hero.jsx         # Entry — or index.jsx, both work

```

### How discovery works

At the **root of `sections/`**, location is the marker. Any file or folder there is a section type — no `meta.js` needed:

- `CTA.jsx` → section type "CTA" with an implicit empty content interface
- `Header/Header.jsx` → section type "Header" with an implicit empty content interface
- `Hero/meta.js` + `Hero.jsx` → section type "Hero" with explicit params and presets

When `meta.js` is absent, the title is inferred from the component name by splitting PascalCase: `TeamRoster` → "Team Roster", `CTA` → "CTA". Add `meta.js` when you need params, content expectations, or a custom title.

**Deeper nesting** requires explicit `meta.js` — because a nested file could be a helper, a variant, or anything else. This enables two useful patterns:

- **Child section types**: `Tabs/Tab/meta.js` — a section type co-located with its parent, expressing the relationship in the file system
- **Organizational subfolders**: `marketing/Hero/meta.js` — grouping section types by category in large foundations

Files without `meta.js` at nested levels are private implementation — invisible to the build.

`components/` is where your React components live, organized however you like. `hooks/` is for custom React hooks. Everything outside `sections/` is standard React. (The build also falls back to scanning `src/components/` for `meta.js`, so older foundations that put section types there continue to work.)

### Entry file conventions

The build supports two naming conventions for the entry file in a section type folder:

- **Named file**: `Hero/Hero.jsx` — clearer in editor tabs when you have many open
- **Index file**: `Hero/index.jsx` — the traditional React convention

Named files are checked first, so if both exist, `Hero.jsx` wins. At the root of `sections/`, bare files like `CTA.jsx` are always named — `index.jsx` at the root has no meaning (there's no "default section type").

### Your components live in `components/`

The `components/` folder is yours — organize it however makes sense for your project. A `components/ui/` subfolder follows the [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) convention (shadcn's CLI installs there by default). Section types import from them like any other module:

```jsx
// sections/Features/Features.jsx
import { Card, CardContent } from '../../components/ui/card'

export default function Features({ content, params }) {
  return (
    <div className="grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
      {content.items.map((item, i) => (
        <Card key={i}>
          <CardContent>
            <h3 style={{ color: 'var(--heading)' }}>{item.title}</h3>
            <p style={{ color: 'var(--text)' }}>{item.paragraphs[0]}</p>
          </CardContent>
        </Card>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

CCA doesn't constrain your import graph. Import from `components/`, from npm packages, from `hooks/`, from sibling files inside the section folder — whatever your rendering needs.

### Section-level styles with `Component.className`

The runtime wraps every component in a `<section>` element (with context classes for theming). Section-level styles — vertical padding, borders, background color — go on this wrapper via `Component.className`, not as an extra wrapping div inside your component:

```jsx
function Features({ content, params }) {
  return (
    <div className="max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4">
      {/* ... content rendering ... */}
    </div>
  )
}

Features.className = 'py-16 md:py-24 border-b border-edge'

export default Features
```

The component's JSX only needs the content-constraint div (`max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4`). The runtime produces:

```html
<section class="context-light py-16 md:py-24 border-b border-edge">
  <div class="max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4">
    ...
  </div>
</section>
```

You can also change the wrapper element with `Component.as`:

```jsx
Header.as = 'nav'       // wraps in <nav> instead of <section>
```

---

## The Dispatcher

You have a Gallery component that needs to render images three different ways: a CSS grid, a masonry layout, and a horizontal carousel. Or a Hero that looks completely different on the homepage versus the pricing page. The content is the same — images with alt text, or a heading with a paragraph and links — but the rendering is structurally different. Different DOM, different CSS strategies, different interaction models.

The Dispatcher pattern handles this. The section type is a thin entry file that reads a param and delegates to separate renderer components. Each renderer is plain React — it doesn't know about CCA. The dispatcher is the only file that touches params and content structure.

```
src/sections/
└── Gallery/
    ├── meta.js           # Content interface — declares layout param
    ├── Gallery.jsx       # Dispatcher — reads param, delegates
    ├── Grid.jsx          # Renderer: CSS grid
    ├── Masonry.jsx       # Renderer: CSS columns
    └── Carousel.jsx      # Renderer: horizontal scroll-snap
```

The meta.js declares the choice:

```js
// meta.js
export default {
  params: {
    layout: {
      type: 'select',
      label: 'Layout',
      options: ['grid', 'masonry', 'carousel'],
      default: 'grid',
    },
  },
}
```

And the entry file dispatches:

```jsx
// Gallery.jsx
import Grid from './Grid'
import Masonry from './Masonry'
import Carousel from './Carousel'

const layouts = { grid: Grid, masonry: Masonry, carousel: Carousel }

export default function Gallery({ content, params }) {
  const Layout = layouts[params.layout] || Grid
  return <Layout imgs={content.imgs} columns={params.columns} />
}
```

That's the entire dispatcher — six lines of logic. Each renderer receives normalized props and renders one way. `Grid.jsx` knows about CSS grid. `Masonry.jsx` knows about CSS columns. `Carousel.jsx` knows about scroll-snap. None of them know about CCA params or content structure. Adding a fourth layout means adding a file and a key to the map, without touching the existing renderers.

The renderer files are invisible to the build — they're nested inside a section type folder without their own `meta.js`. They're ordinary React modules.

The content author writes the same markdown in every case — just images with alt text. The `layout` param changes everything about how those images appear. One component name, one content structure, three completely different visual results.

### When the variants are lighter

Not every dispatcher needs separate files. When variants differ in styling but share the same DOM structure, a class map inside the entry file is enough:

```jsx
// Features.jsx — variants differ in class sets, not structure
const styles = {
  cards: {
    container: 'p-6 rounded-xl bg-surface',
    icon: 'w-12 h-12 rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center mb-4',
  },
  minimal: {
    container: 'text-center',
    icon: 'w-14 h-14 rounded-xl flex items-center justify-center mb-4 mx-auto',
  },
  list: {
    container: 'flex gap-4',
    icon: 'w-10 h-10 rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center flex-shrink-0',
  },
}

export default function Features({ content, params }) {
  const s = styles[params.style] || styles.cards
  // ... render items using s.container, s.icon
}
```

This is a lighter form of the same pattern — the entry file reads a param and selects a rendering strategy. The difference is that the strategies are class maps rather than separate components. Use separate files when variants have different DOM structures or interaction logic; use inline maps when they share the same JSX and only differ in classes. (See [Static Class Maps](#static-class-maps) for more on how these maps work with Tailwind.)

### Variant naming

The instinct when consolidating similar components is to find clever, abstract names for each variant. "What *is* the homepage hero, really? A split-media? A content-with-aside?"

Don't do that. The dispatcher pattern doesn't require elegant abstraction. It requires consolidation.

```js
// meta.js — and this is fine
export default {
  params: {
    variant: {
      type: 'select',
      label: 'Layout',
      options: ['homepage', 'centered', 'directory', 'split-form'],
      default: 'homepage',
    },
  },
}
```

Those names came from where the variants were found. That's fine — "I want the hero to look like the homepage" is a perfectly good selection criterion. You're not shipping an open-source component library where `homepage` would be meaningless. You're shipping a foundation for a site (or family of sites) where these names map to real, tested layouts.

The win is consolidation: one component name, one meta.js, one place to add future variants. Not five components with five names in the content author's palette. The variant vocabulary can evolve later — start with names that are meaningful now.

(If you're consolidating variants from an existing site or AI-generated pages, see [Converting Existing Designs](./converting-existing-designs.md) for the staged migration approach — including how to keep legacy implementations untouched in `components/` while the section type dispatches to them.)

---

## Building Blocks

In CCA, each section on a page renders top-to-bottom — one after another. But some designs need sections *side by side*. A "Research & Data" page with two panels in a 2:1 split. A dashboard with three cards across. A comparison layout with two section types next to each other.

You can't get there by making each panel its own top-level section — the runtime renders sections sequentially. The solution is a **Grid** component that arranges child sections within a single grid layout. The Grid is a known, abstract concept — content authors understand "put these things in a grid" even if they don't know CSS. We've found that this level of composition works well without confusing authors, while more exotic composition patterns tend to be harder to explain.

### How child blocks work

The content author nests sections inside a Grid in `page.yml`:

```yaml
# pages/home/page.yml
sections:
  hero: Hero
  layout:
    type: Grid
    params:
      columns: 2
    sections:
      - type: FieldNotes
      - type: Sightings
```

The Grid component receives `block.childBlocks` — an array of Block instances, each with its own type, content, and params. The component controls the container; the children control themselves:

```jsx
import { ChildBlocks } from '@uniweb/runtime'

export default function Grid({ block, params }) {
  const { columns } = params

  const gridCols = {
    2: 'grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2',
    3: 'grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3',
    4: 'grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4',
  }

  return (
    <div className={cn('grid gap-6', gridCols[columns])}>
      <ChildBlocks from={block} pure />
    </div>
  )
}
```

`ChildBlocks` renders each child block through the same BlockRenderer pipeline that renders top-level sections. The `pure` prop is important here — see below.

### The `pure` prop

By default, `ChildBlocks` wraps each child in its own element with context classes, background rendering, and section ID — the same treatment top-level sections get. For grid cells, this is usually wrong: each child gets its own background layer, padding context, and wrapper element inside your grid cell, fighting with the grid's layout.

Pass `pure` to strip all of that:

```jsx
<ChildBlocks from={block} pure />
```

With `pure`, each child renders as just the component — no wrapper element, no context class, no background layer. The Grid controls the container entirely; the children render their content directly into the grid cells.

Use `pure` when children are **visual parts of the parent** — grid cells, tab panels, carousel slides. Omit it when children are **independent sections** that should carry their own theming and backgrounds (rare for grid layouts, but possible for more advanced composition).

You can also control the wrapper element type with `as`:

```jsx
{/* Each child wrapped in <article> instead of the default <div> */}
<ChildBlocks from={block} as="article" />

{/* No wrapper at all */}
<ChildBlocks from={block} as={false} />
```

### Container queries

Container queries make Grid composition powerful. A Features component that renders a 3-column card grid at full width can drop to a single column when it's inside a 2-column Grid cell — without knowing anything about the Grid. The component queries its own container's width, not the viewport:

```css
@container (min-width: 40rem) {
  .feature-grid { grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); }
}
```

This means the same component works at full width on one page and inside a grid cell on another — adapting its internal layout to however much space it has. Content authors get flexible composition without components needing to know about each other.

### Why this matters

With one Grid component and a `columns` param, content authors can create any side-by-side layout. A FieldNotes component renders field notes. A Sightings component renders sightings. Neither knows it's inside a grid cell — and neither should. Adding a third column means changing `columns: 3` in the page configuration, not touching any component code.

**The key insight:** Grid components separate *arrangement* from *content*. The Grid controls the container. The content components control themselves. Content authors compose the two by nesting sections in page configuration.

---

## Structured Data in Components

Content authors pass structured data to components using tagged code blocks in markdown:

````markdown
```yaml:nav
items:
  - label: Overview
    icon: lu:layout-grid
    href: "#overview"
  - label: Documentation
    icon: lu:book-open
    href: "#docs"
```
````

The tag after the colon (`nav`) routes the parsed YAML to `content.data.nav`. Your component reads it:

```jsx
import { Icon } from '@uniweb/kit'

export default function Sidebar({ content }) {
  const navItems = content.data?.nav?.items || []

  return (
    <nav>
      {navItems.map((item, i) => (
        <a key={i} href={item.href} className="flex items-center gap-2 text-body hover:text-link">
          <Icon icon={item.icon} size="18" />
          <span>{item.label}</span>
        </a>
      ))}
    </nav>
  )
}
```

### How it works

1. Content author writes `` ```yaml:tag `` in their markdown
2. The content reader parses the YAML and stores it keyed by tag
3. The semantic parser passes it through to `content.data`
4. Your component reads `content.data.tag`

Multiple tagged blocks accumulate — `` ```yaml:nav `` and `` ```yaml:config `` in the same file produce `content.data.nav` and `content.data.config`. Both YAML and JSON formats work (`` ```json:tag ``).

### When to use structured data vs content items

Use **`content.items`** (heading-separated content) when the data is presentational — cards, team members, FAQ entries — where each item has a natural title, description, image, and links.

Use **`content.data`** (tagged code blocks) when the data is configuration — form field definitions, chart datasets, navigation structures, pricing tier metadata — that doesn't map to the heading/paragraph/image content model.

Some components use both: a Pricing section might use `content.items` for the tier cards (title, price, feature list, CTA link) and `content.data.pricing` for billing toggle configuration.

---

## Multi-Source Rendering

CCA components can receive content from markdown items *or* from external data (API responses, collections, fetched profiles). The component adapts to whichever source is present.

The Team component from the marketing template shows this clearly:

```jsx
export default function Team({ content, params }) {
  // Support both fetched data and markdown items
  const rawMembers = content.data.team || content.items || []

  // Normalize to consistent shape
  const members = rawMembers.map((member) => {
    if (member.name !== undefined) {
      // Fetched data format: { name, role, bio, avatar, social }
      return {
        name: member.name,
        role: member.role,
        bio: member.bio || member.body,
        photo: member.avatar ? { url: member.avatar } : null,
        socialLinks: Object.entries(member.social || {})
          .filter(([, url]) => url)
          .map(([platform, url]) => ({ href: url, text: platform })),
      }
    }
    // Markdown items format: { title, paragraphs, imgs, links }
    return {
      name: member.title,
      role: member.paragraphs?.[0],
      bio: member.paragraphs?.[1],
      photo: member.imgs?.[0],
      socialLinks: member.links || [],
    }
  })

  // From here, render `members` — same code regardless of source
}
```

The content author doesn't choose the data source. They either write markdown:

```markdown

```

Or configure a data fetch in `page.yml`:

```yaml
data:
  team:
    source: /api/team
```

The component handles both. The rendering code after normalization is identical — it maps over `members` and renders cards.

**The key insight:** This means the same component serves static sites (markdown content) and dynamic sites (API-backed data) without the content author needing to understand the distinction. The normalization layer is the boundary — above it, two data shapes; below it, one rendering path.

---

## Loading States

When a section type fetches data at runtime (`prerender: false`), there's a gap between the first render and data arrival. Without handling it, the page collapses — header and footer slam together while the section has nothing to show. The component renders immediately and controls its own loading UI.

```js
// meta.js
export default {
  data: {
    entity: 'articles:6',
  },
}
```

The component checks `block.dataLoading` to decide what to render:

```jsx
import { DataPlaceholder } from '@uniweb/kit'

export default function ArticleList({ content, block, params }) {
  if (block.dataLoading) {
    return (
      <section>
        <h2 style={{ color: 'var(--heading)' }}>{content.title}</h2>
        <DataPlaceholder lines={4} />
      </section>
    )
  }

  const articles = content.data.articles || []
  return (
    <section>
      <h2 style={{ color: 'var(--heading)' }}>{content.title}</h2>
      <div className="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6">
        {articles.map((a, i) => <ArticleCard key={i} article={a} />)}
      </div>
    </section>
  )
}
```

Static content — title, paragraphs, items from markdown — is available on the first render. Only the fetched data in `content.data` is pending. That's why the example renders the title immediately and only wraps the data-dependent part in a loading check. The component holds its space, the page doesn't jump, and the content author's headline is visible from the start.

`DataPlaceholder` is a convenience — animated pulse bars from kit. If the design calls for a custom skeleton, read `block.dataLoading` directly and render whatever fits.

---

## Conditional Properties

When a component has many params, the author's editing UI can become cluttered with options that aren't relevant. Conditional properties hide params based on the current value of other params.

Consider a Grid component with a `columns` param and layout ratio options for 2-column layouts:

```js
// meta.js
params: {
  columns: {
    type: 'select',
    label: 'Columns',
    options: [
      { value: 2, label: '2 Columns' },
      { value: 3, label: '3 Columns' },
      { value: 4, label: '4 Columns' },
    ],
    default: 3,
  },
  ratio: {
    type: 'select',
    label: 'Column Ratio',
    options: [
      { value: '50-50', label: 'Equal (50/50)' },
      { value: '40-60', label: 'Narrow / Wide (40/60)' },
      { value: '60-40', label: 'Wide / Narrow (60/40)' },
      { value: '33-67', label: 'Sidebar / Main (33/67)' },
    ],
    default: '50-50',
    condition: { columns: 2 },
  },
}
```

The `ratio` param only appears when `columns` is `2`. For 3- or 4-column layouts, it vanishes — because column ratios don't apply when all columns are equal.

Without this, a Grid with 4 column options and 4 ratio options shows 8 controls at all times. With conditional properties, authors see at most 5 — the 4 column options, plus the ratio options only when they're meaningful.

**The key insight:** Conditional properties aren't just about cleaner UI. They prevent invalid configurations. A content author can't set a 60/40 ratio on a 3-column grid because the option doesn't exist in that state. The meta.js constrains the configuration space to only valid combinations.

---

## Static Class Maps

Tailwind's JIT compiler scans your source files for class strings at build time. It needs to find complete class names — it can't piece together fragments. This has a specific implication for CCA components: param values can't be interpolated into class names.

```jsx
// ❌ Tailwind can't find this — it never appears as a complete string
className={`py-${size}`}

// ❌ This either — template literals are opaque to the scanner
className={`grid-cols-${columns}`}
```

The solution is static maps — objects where every value is a complete, scannable class string:

```jsx
const padding = {
  sm: 'py-2 lg:py-4',
  md: 'py-4 lg:py-8',
  lg: 'py-8 lg:py-16',
}

const gridCols = {
  2: 'sm:grid-cols-2',
  3: 'sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3',
  4: 'sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4',
}

<div className={cn(padding[params.spacing], gridCols[params.columns])}>
```

Every string in the map is a complete token that Tailwind can find by scanning the file. The keys are param values. The values are the CSS.

This is more than a workaround — it's a better design. Each entry in the map is a *complete responsive declaration*. `sm` doesn't mean "small padding" — it means a specific set of breakpoint-aware values that the foundation designer chose. The content author sees "Small", "Medium", "Large" in the UI; the developer controls exactly what each label means in CSS.

This pattern appears throughout the marketing template. The Features component maps `columns` to responsive grid classes. The Gallery maps `columns` to both grid and masonry variants. The CTA maps `theme` to coordinated class sets for section, button, secondary button, and description text — all as static objects.

```jsx
// CTA component — multiple elements, one param, all static
const buttonStyles = {
  primary: 'bg-white text-primary hover:bg-blue-50',
  gradient: 'bg-white text-primary hover:bg-blue-50',
  dark: 'bg-white text-gray-900 hover:bg-gray-100',
  light: 'bg-primary text-white hover:bg-blue-700',
}

const descStyles = {
  primary: 'text-blue-100',
  gradient: 'text-blue-100',
  dark: 'text-gray-400',
  light: 'text-gray-600',
}
```

One `theme` param, four coordinated maps. Every value scannable. Every combination tested.

---

## Parameters as Intent

This has been covered elsewhere (see [Thinking in Contexts](./thinking-in-contexts.md) and [Converting Existing Designs](./converting-existing-designs.md)), but it's worth reinforcing here because the component patterns above depend on it.

Params describe purpose, not CSS. A `spacing: comfortable` param isn't a CSS shortcut; it's a semantic choice that the foundation designer maps to whatever values serve the design. `layout: masonry` isn't `columns: 3` with extra steps; it's a named rendering strategy that encapsulates responsive behavior, gap logic, and break-inside rules.

The constraint is generative — like writing testable code. When you can't expose `className` or `style` directly, you're forced to ask: what are the *meaningful* variations of this component? The answers become the param options, and those options are all tested, all responsive, all compatible with the foundation's design system. You end up with a tighter interface than "pass whatever CSS you want" — fewer invalid states, less surface area to maintain.

But — as discussed in the [Dispatcher](#the-dispatcher) section — "purpose-based" doesn't mean "abstractly named." A Gallery's `layout: masonry` is purpose-based: the author wants a masonry look. A Hero's `variant: homepage` is also purpose-based: the author wants the homepage look. Both are meaningful to the person choosing them. The line is between intent ("I want this layout") and implementation ("give me `grid-cols-3` and `py-8`"). Variant names that came from real pages in a real site are intent — the author recognizes them. CSS fragments are implementation — the author shouldn't see them.

## Page Layout

The runtime's default Layout renders every page as three areas — `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>` — stacked vertically. Sections within each area render sequentially. This is what you get without any configuration:

```html
<header>  <!-- layout/header/ sections (0 or more) -->
<main>    <!-- page body sections (0 or more) -->
<footer>  <!-- layout/footer/ sections (0 or more) -->
```

Header and footer content comes from the `layout/header/` and `layout/footer/` folders. The default Layout ignores left and right panel content (`layout/left/`, `layout/right/`).

### `Component.as` — controlling the wrapper tag

By default, the runtime wraps each section in a `<section>` element. Components can change this with the `Component.as` static prop:

```jsx
function Header({ content, params }) {
  // ... header rendering
}

Header.as = 'nav'

export default Header
```

Now the runtime wraps this component in `<nav>` instead of `<section>`. This is purely semantic — use it when the HTML element matters (`nav` for navigation, `article` for blog posts, `aside` for sidebars).

### Header positioning: sticky vs fixed

The runtime wraps header sections in a bare `<header>` element (a semantic zone wrapper). Your component renders _inside_ this wrapper. This matters for CSS positioning because `sticky` only works relative to the nearest scrolling ancestor — and the `<header>` wrapper sits between your component and the scroll container.

There are two clean approaches:

**Approach 1: Fixed positioning + placeholder (recommended)**

Use `fixed` inside the component. Fixed positioning is relative to the viewport, so it bypasses the zone wrapper entirely. A placeholder div reserves space in the document flow:

```jsx
function Header({ content, params }) {
  const isFloating = params.floating

  return (
    <>
      <div className="fixed top-0 left-0 right-0 z-50 bg-white/95 backdrop-blur ...">
        <nav className="max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4">...</nav>
      </div>
      {!isFloating && <div className="h-16" />}
    </>
  )
}

Header.as = 'nav'
```

This is the recommended approach because real-world headers almost always have parameterized behavior — a `floating` mode that overlaps the hero, transparent-to-solid transitions on scroll, show/hide based on scroll direction. All of that lives naturally in the component when positioning is `fixed`. The placeholder is conditional: present for normal headers, absent for floating headers that overlap content.

**Approach 2: CSS on the zone wrapper**

For headers with no scroll-dependent behavior, target the runtime's `<header>` element directly in your foundation's stylesheet:

```css
/* foundation/src/styles.css */
header {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  z-index: 50;
}
```

This lets `sticky` work naturally — the `<header>` itself becomes the sticky element. The component doesn't need to know about zone wrappers at all. This is a good reminder that CSS gives foundations full control over the runtime's HTML structure, even elements the framework generates. The limitation is that it's static — the component can't toggle it based on params or scroll state.

**Custom layouts** are a third option: when a foundation exports its own Layout component, it renders the `<header>` element directly and can add `sticky` to it. See [Custom Layouts](custom-layouts.md) for details.

> **Note:** `Component.className` and `Component.as` control the _section_ wrapper (the element immediately around your component), not the _zone_ wrapper (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`). Putting `sticky top-0` on `Component.className` won't make the header stick — the zone wrapper is the element that needs to be sticky.

### Custom Layouts

The default header/body/footer stack works for most sites. When you need sidebars, panels, or a non-standard page structure, the foundation provides a custom Layout via `src/exports.js`:

```jsx
// foundation/src/exports.js
import { SidebarLayout } from '@uniweb/kit'

export default {
  Layout: SidebarLayout,
}
```

A Layout component receives pre-rendered areas as props:

```jsx
function CustomLayout({ page, website, header, body, footer, left, right }) {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen flex flex-col">
      <header className="sticky top-0 z-30">{header}</header>
      <div className="flex flex-1">
        {left && <aside className="w-64 hidden md:block">{left}</aside>}
        <main className="flex-1">{body}</main>
        {right && <aside className="w-64 hidden xl:block">{right}</aside>}
      </div>
      <footer>{footer}</footer>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Kit provides `SidebarLayout` — a ready-made layout with responsive left/right panels, a mobile slide-out drawer for the left panel, sticky header support, and configurable breakpoints. Use it directly or wrap it with custom props:

```jsx
import { SidebarLayout } from '@uniweb/kit'

function DocsLayout(props) {
  return (
    <SidebarLayout
      {...props}
      leftBreakpoint="lg"
      rightBreakpoint="xl"
      leftWidth="w-72"
    />
  )
}

export default { Layout: DocsLayout }
```

Panel content comes from the layout folders — `layout/left/` and `layout/right/` — following the same pattern as `layout/header/` and `layout/footer/`.

## What's Next

These are the patterns we've found so far by building foundations with CCA. More will emerge — especially around:

- **Data-driven composition**, where collections and fetched data create section structures that don't exist in the markdown
- **Cross-section communication**, where one component's state (like a filter) affects what other sections display
- **Adaptive complexity**, where a component scales its rendering based on how much content the author provided

This guide will grow as those patterns become clear. If you discover something that feels like a reusable pattern while building your foundation, it probably is.
