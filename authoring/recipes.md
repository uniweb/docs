# Content Recipes

Copy-paste solutions for common content patterns. Each recipe shows the markdown you write and notes on key points.

For deeper explanations, see the [Writing Content](./writing-content.md) guide.

**Note:** These recipes use generic type names (`Hero`, `Features`, `FAQ`, etc.). Your site's template may use different names — check the existing `.md` files in your site to see what types are available, and your template's documentation for details.

```

- The `### → #` pattern creates a pretitle ("Welcome to") above the title.
- Standalone links become CTA buttons. The section type decides how they look.
- The image, links, and paragraphs are ingredients — the section type arranges them.

```

- Just list your images. The section type handles the gallery layout.
- Alt text is important for accessibility and may be used as captions.

---

### Logo Cloud

A row of partner or client logos.

```markdown
---
type: LogoCloud
---

# Trusted By

![Acme Corp](./logos/acme.svg)

````markdown
---
type: Contact
---

# Get in Touch

We'd love to hear from you. Fill out the form below and we'll get back to you within 24 hours.

![](lu-mail)

```yaml:form
fields:
  - name: name
    label: Full Name
    type: text
    required: true
  - name: email
    label: Email Address
    type: email
    required: true
  - name: subject
    label: Subject
    type: select
    options:
      - General Inquiry
      - Technical Support
      - Partnership
  - name: message
    label: Message
    type: textarea
    required: true
submitLabel: Send Message
successMessage: Thanks! We'll be in touch soon.
```
````

- The YAML data block configures the form. The tag name (`form`) and field structure depend on what your template's Contact type expects — check your template's documentation.

---

## Navigation & Layout

### Header with Navigation

Site-wide header. This lives in `layout/header/header.md`.

```markdown
---
type: Header
---

![Logo](./logo.svg){role=icon}

[Home](/)
[Products](/products)
[Docs](/docs)
[Pricing](/pricing)
[Contact](/contact)
```

- The `layout/header/` folder makes this appear on every page.
- The icon with `role=icon` becomes the site logo.
- Standalone links become navigation items.

**Auto-navigation alternative**: Some Header types automatically build navigation from your page structure, so you may not need to list links manually. Check the header file that came with your template.

---

### Footer with Link Columns

Site-wide footer. This lives in `layout/footer/footer.md`.

```markdown
---
type: Footer
---

### Product

[Features](/features)
[Pricing](/pricing)
[Changelog](/changelog)
[Roadmap](/roadmap)

### Company

[About](/about)
[Careers](/careers)
[Blog](/blog)
[Press](/press)

### Legal

[Privacy Policy](/privacy)
[Terms of Service](/terms)

---

![](lu-twitter){href="https://twitter.com/example" target=_blank}
![](lu-github){href="https://github.com/example" target=_blank}
![](lu-linkedin){href="https://linkedin.com/company/example" target=_blank}

© 2025 Acme Corp. All rights reserved.
```

- Each `###` heading creates a link column.
- Clickable icons (with `href`) become social media links.
- The final paragraph is the copyright notice.

---

## Pages & Routes

### Adding a New Page

Create a folder under `pages/` and add a `.md` file:

```
pages/
├── home/
├── about/
└── pricing/          ← new page
    └── content.md
```

```markdown
---
type: Pricing
---

# Our Plans

Choose the right plan for you.
```

The page automatically appears at `/pricing` and shows up in navigation. The title defaults to the folder name.

To set a custom title, description, or ordering, add a `page.yml`:

```yaml
title: Pricing
description: Our plans and pricing
order: 3
```

**Tip**: Use `index:` in `site.yml` (not `pages:`) to set your homepage. This way new pages are auto-discovered in navigation without manually updating a list.

---

### Linking Between Pages

Use the `page:` protocol for internal links that won't break if you reorganize:

```markdown
[See our pricing](page:pricing)
[Read the docs](page:docs)
[Contact us](page:about#contact)
```

For simple cases, plain paths work too:

```markdown
[Pricing](/pricing)
```

But `page:` links survive if you move pages to different folders. For pages you link to often, add an `id` in their `page.yml`:

```yaml
# pages/docs/getting-started/installation/page.yml
id: installation
title: Installation Guide
```

Now `[Install guide](page:installation)` works no matter where the page lives.

---

### Blog with Article List and Detail Pages

Set up a blog with a list page and individual article pages.

**1. Create a collection** in `site.yml`:

```yaml
collections:
  articles:
    path: collections/articles
    sort: date desc
```

**2. Add article files** in `collections/articles/`:

```
collections/articles/
├── hello-world.md
├── new-feature.md
└── tips-and-tricks.md
```

Each article has frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: Hello World
date: 2025-01-15
description: Our first blog post
thumbnail: ./hello-thumb.jpg
---

Welcome to our blog! Here's what we've been building...
```

**3. Create the blog list page**:

```
pages/blog/
├── page.yml
└── list.md
```

```yaml
# pages/blog/page.yml
title: Blog
data: articles
```

```markdown
<!-- pages/blog/list.md -->
---
type: ArticleList
---

# Blog

The latest from our team.
```

**4. Create the article detail route**:

```
pages/blog/
├── page.yml
├── list.md
└── [slug]/
    └── article.md
```

```markdown
<!-- pages/blog/[slug]/article.md -->
---
type: Article
---
```

- The `[slug]` folder creates a dynamic route (`/blog/my-post`).
- The `data: articles` in `page.yml` makes article data available to the page.
- Dynamic route pages don't appear in navigation — they're generated from data.

---

### Adding Search to Your Site

**1. Enable search** in `site.yml`:

```yaml
search:
  enabled: true
```

**2. Check your template** — most templates include search UI that works automatically once search is enabled.

That's it. The build generates a search index, and the search UI loads it on demand.

**Optional configuration**:

```yaml
search:
  enabled: true
  exclude:
    routes:
      - /admin
      - /draft
```

See the [Search guide](../search.md) for full configuration options.

## Content Patterns

### Hero with Background Image

Any section can have a background image — just add `background:` to the frontmatter. The simplest form is a URL:

```markdown
---
type: Hero
theme: dark
background: /images/hero-bg.jpg
---

# Transform Your Business

Start building with modern tools today.

[Get Started](/signup)
```

For busy images, add an overlay to keep text readable:

```markdown
---
type: Hero
theme: dark
background:
  image:
    src: /images/hero-bg.jpg
    position: center
  overlay:
    enabled: true
    type: dark
    opacity: 0.6
---

# Transform Your Business

Start building with modern tools today.

[Get Started](/signup)
```

- Background images appear behind the content, covering the full section.
- Overlays add a semi-transparent layer so text stays readable. Use `type: dark` or `type: light`.
- Adjust `opacity` (0 to 1) — higher values make the overlay stronger.

---

### Section with Background Color

Any section can use a solid color as its background:

```markdown
---
type: CTA
theme: dark
background: "#1e1e2e"
---

# Ready to Get Started?

Join thousands of teams already using our platform.

[Sign Up Free](/signup)
```

- You can use hex colors (`#1e1e2e`), CSS color names (`navy`), or theme variables (`var(--primary-900)`).
- When using a dark background color, set `theme: dark` so the text colors adapt.

---

### Section with Gradient Background

```markdown
---
type: Hero
theme: dark
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%)
---

# Build Something Beautiful

Modern tools for modern teams.

[Get Started](/signup)
```

- Any CSS gradient works: `linear-gradient(...)`, `radial-gradient(...)`, `conic-gradient(...)`.
- Combine with `theme: dark` for light text on dark gradients.

---

### Hero with Background Video

```markdown
---
type: Hero
theme: dark
background:
  video:
    src: /videos/hero.mp4
    poster: /images/hero-poster.jpg
  overlay:
    enabled: true
    type: dark
    opacity: 0.5
---

# See It in Action

Watch how easy it is to get started.

[Try Free](/signup)
```

- Video backgrounds automatically show a still image for users who prefer reduced motion.
- The poster image shows while the video loads.
- You can also use the simple form: `background: /videos/hero.mp4` (video detected by extension).

---

### Multi-Section Page

A complete page with several sections, each using a different type:

```
pages/home/
├── page.yml
├── 1-hero.md
├── 2-logos.md
├── 3-features.md
├── 4-testimonials.md
├── 5-pricing.md
└── 6-cta.md
```

Each file has its own `type:` in the frontmatter. The number prefix controls the order. You can freely add, remove, or reorder sections by changing the filenames.

---

## Analytics & Third-Party Scripts

To add Google Analytics, tracking pixels, or any other service that asks you to "paste this code into your site's `<head>`":

1. Create a file called `head.html` in your site folder (next to `site.yml`)
2. Paste the code the service gives you

That's it. The build injects it into every page automatically.

### Google Analytics

```html
<!-- site/head.html -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
</script>
```

Replace `G-XXXXXXXXXX` with your Measurement ID (found in Google Analytics → Admin → Data Streams).

### Multiple scripts

You can put as many scripts as you need in `head.html`. Just paste them one after another:

```html
<!-- Google Analytics -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>/* ... */</script>

<!-- Cookie consent -->
<script src="https://cdn.example.com/consent.js"></script>
```
